/**
 * dsh-comfyui host configuration. The same schema drives the Loader entry
 * config (cordis.yml patch) and the settings page, so one shape covers both
 * doors into the same values.
 *
 * Fields the plugin reads at use time are `.volatile()`: since dsh 0.1.7 the
 * settings service only edits volatile fields (anything else fails with
 * "Plugin entry has no volatile fields", Issue #11), and the Loader commits a
 * volatile-only change into the running references without restarting the
 * plugin. `dataDir` / `maxAssets` / `outputDir` stay ordinary: the store is
 * built from them at startup, so a change there restarts the plugin.
