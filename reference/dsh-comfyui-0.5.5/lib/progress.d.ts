/**
 * Live generation progress, fed by ComfyUI's WebSocket. The server broadcasts
 * `progress` events ({value, max, node, prompt_id}) to every connected client,
 * so one shared socket tracks progress for all queue tasks — including ones
 * the plugin did not submit. Progress is best-effort: a remote server behind
 * an authenticating proxy (or one that never connects) simply shows queue
 * tasks without a progress bar. Reconnects on drop until dispose.
