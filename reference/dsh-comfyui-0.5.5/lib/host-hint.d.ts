/**
 * Host hint: remember the origin browsers use to reach this web server, so
 * generated media URLs (tool results) point at an address the requesting
 * browser can actually load. The hint is derived from the Host header and the
 * Referer of every /comfyui/* request the browser makes: a panel load records
 * the Host header before any generation happens, and a media <img> fetch
 * carries the page's own URL in Referer — which recovers the external origin
 * even when an earlier generated URL already fell back to loopback.
 *
 * Loopback origins (127.0.0.1/localhost) never displace an already-seen
 * external origin: server-side tool calls and local debug requests must not
 * overwrite the address remote browsers use.
